  "about": {
    "origin": "It was a regular day when we, Mohit and Surya Purohit, were heading to Ghaziabad Railway Station from our society. We booked a cab and noticed another person also taking a cab from our area. When we reached the station, we saw the same person at the parking lot. That's when it hit us - we both paid ₹300 separately for the same route. If we had known we were going to the same place, we could have shared the ride and paid just ₹300 total, saving ₹300 together!",
    "spark": "This sparked an idea, but we didn't want to do traditional carpooling with private cars — that's not legal for commercial use and bypasses taxi drivers who depend on fares. Instead, we pioneered 'Cab Pooling' — pooling commercial cabs among verified riders. It's 100% legal, supports drivers, AND reduces road emissions by 75%. That's how Snapgo was born.",
    "mission": "To make travel affordable and accessible for everyone through cab pooling — connecting people who share similar routes while supporting drivers and reducing environmental impact.",
    "vision": "To become India's most trusted cab pooling platform, where every shared ride means savings for riders, earnings for drivers, and a greener planet for everyone.",
    "values": "Legal and ethical operations, driver-friendly ecosystem, environmental sustainability, user safety, and creating value for our entire community."
